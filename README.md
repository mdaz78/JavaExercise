# Java Programming Masterclass Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to various programming exercises from the Java Programming Masterclass. Each exercise is designed to strengthen different aspects of Java programming fundamentals.

## üéØ Course Progress

Here are the exercises I've completed so far:

### Basic Control Flow and Logic

1. **Positive, Negative, or Zero Checker**

   - Practice with conditional statements
   - Simple number classification

2. **Barking Dog**

   - Boolean logic implementation
   - Time-based decision making

3. **Speed Converter**

   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Unit conversion (kilometers to miles)
   - Number rounding techniques

4. **MegaBytes Converter**
   - Data unit conversion
   - String formatting
   - Integer arithmetic

### Number Operations and Comparisons

5. **Decimal Comparator**

   - Floating-point number comparison
   - Precision handling up to three decimal places

6. **Equal Sum Checker**

   - Integer arithmetic
   - Basic number comparison

7. **Teen Number Checker**

   - Range checking
   - Multiple parameter handling
   - Method overloading

8. **Leap Year Calculator**
   - Complex conditional logic
   - Date calculations
   - Multiple rule implementation

## üõ† Skills Demonstrated

- Basic Java syntax and structure
- Method creation and overloading
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Boolean logic
- Data type handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Input validation
- Code organization
- Clean coding practices

## üîç Code Structure

Each exercise is implemented in its own Java class file with:

- Clear problem description in comments
- Solution implementation
- Test cases in the main method
- Input validation where required

## üöÄ Future Updates

I will continue to add more exercises as I progress through the course, covering topics such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Collections
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- And more...
